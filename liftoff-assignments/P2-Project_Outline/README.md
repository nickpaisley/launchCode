# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a web based CookBook site called Hangry. 

Users will be given a Menu that they can populate with Meals to review later and for other users to browse for ideas. Meal pages will contain a picture of the completed meal, a list of ingredients required and the process to cook the Meal. While this is not a revolutionary idea, it will serve as a way to use everything we have learned so far in one place. This idea springs from watching my wife cook for the family. Currently she uses a paper based system that is hard for anyone but herself to browse through and is getting a little out of hand. I want her to be able to store her meals digitally for recall later and also to allow me to browse through her Menu to determine what I would like for dinner. 




### Features
User Login: Users will be able create accounts and login. Users will also be able to attach a Kroger account that the Kroger API will use.

Menus: Each user will be able to build a Menu that contains a list of submitted Meals.

Meals: Meal pages will contain a picture of the completed meal, a list of ingredients required and the process to cook the Meal.

Kroger API: Incorporate the Kroger API, allowing the user to see a total cost for the ingredients required to produce the meal and add them to a Kroger Cart for purchasing.

Search: Allow users to search through Menus based on keywords such as types of Spices or Meats. Hangry for something with Curry? Chicken or Beef?


### Technologies
Backend: Java

MVC Framework: Spring Boot

Database: MySQL
